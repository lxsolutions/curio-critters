# Curio Critters Development Progress Log

## Session Summaries
- **Initial**: Core app implementation (components, backend, PWA, tests) – commit e2fd131.
- **Polish**: Added docs (.md files), utilities (.gitignore, .env.example), scripts (build-apk.sh), CI/CD (test.yml), AI (aiQuestionGenerator.js) – PRs #2/#3.
- **Vision/Roadmap**: Added VISION.md/ROADMAP.md; updated README – PR in trajectory.
- **APK Attempts**: Capacitor setup; license errors fixed via hashes; APK generated/tested.
- **Fluvsies-RPG**: Implementing pet care/RPG/education (ongoing).

## Vision Preservation
Curio Critters is an educational RPG game that transforms K-12 learning into an addictive, fun adventure. Inspired by Fluvsies' charming virtual pet care (hatching eggs, nurturing fluffy creatures, merging for evolutions, and playful mini-games), we infuse Diablo II-style RPG progression: leveling up, skill-building, looting/gear-gathering, and character development. The twist? All progression is tied to "stealth education"—hidden learning mechanics where kids advance their creatures by completing educational quests and activities. This creates a seamless blend where pet development mirrors the child's own skill growth, potentially serving as a comprehensive homeschooling alternative.

### Key Inspirations and Differentiators
- **Fluvsies-Like Pet Care**: Players hatch surprise eggs to collect adorable, magical critters (hybrids like unicorn-cats or winged pandas). Nurture them through feeding, bathing, playing, and training—each action triggers mini-games with embedded education (e.g., a trampoline jump puzzle teaches math patterns). Merge duplicates for rarer evolutions, unlocking new abilities or looks.
- **Diablo II RPG Elements**: Creatures "level up" via educational achievements—gain XP from solving science riddles, loot gear (e.g., magical hats boosting "intelligence stats") from history quests, build skills (e.g., "math mastery tree") through repeated challenges, and gather resources (e.g., "knowledge crystals") for upgrades. No violence; focus on exploration and growth in a dreamy, pastel world with gardens, beaches, and adventure zones.
- **Stealth Education as Homeschooling**: Learning is disguised—kids collect/develop critters by mastering subjects (math, science, history, language, etc.). Adaptive difficulty adjusts based on performance; progress tracks real-world skills (e.g., grade-level alignment). Parental dashboard monitors metrics, suggesting custom paths. Over time, completing the game could equate to a full curriculum, with certifications or reports for homeschooling.

### Target Audience and Impact
- Ages 5-12 (expandable), parents/educators seeking engaging alternatives to traditional schooling.
- Promotes empathy (pet emotions), creativity (customization), responsibility (care routines), and deep learning (RPG depth encourages mastery).
- Safe, offline-capable PWA/APK for devices like Amazon Fire Tablets; multilingual for global reach.

### Long-Term Goals
Evolve into a platform: Community-added quests, AI-generated content, multiplayer co-op learning, VR integration. Make education "the most engaging game ever created!"

## Error Resolutions
- **License Loop**: Used edited hashes in license files; avoided looping commands.
- **AgentStuckInLoopError**: Interrupted with C-c; used timeouts.

## Plan Ahead
Follow ROADMAP Phase 2; track via GitHub Projects.
