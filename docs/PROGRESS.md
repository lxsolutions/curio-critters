# Curio Critters Development Progress Log

## Session Summaries
- **Initial**: Core app implementation (components, backend, PWA, tests) – commit e2fd131.
- **Polish**: Added docs (.md files), utilities (.gitignore, .env.example), scripts (build-apk.sh), CI/CD (test.yml), AI (aiQuestionGenerator.js) – PRs #2/#3.
- **Vision/Roadmap**: Added VISION.md/ROADMAP.md; updated README – PR in trajectory.
- **APK Attempts**: Capacitor setup; license errors fixed via hashes; APK generated/tested.
- **Fluvsies-RPG**: Implementing pet care/RPG/education (ongoing).
- **Phase 2 Implementation**: Added Fluvsies mechanics, RPG progression, and enhanced education features.

## Vision Preservation
Curio Critters is an educational RPG game that transforms K-12 learning into an addictive, fun adventure. Inspired by Fluvsies' charming virtual pet care (hatching eggs, nurturing fluffy creatures, merging for evolutions, and playful mini-games), we infuse Diablo II-style RPG progression: leveling up, skill-building, looting/gear-gathering, and character development. The twist? All progression is tied to "stealth education"—hidden learning mechanics where kids advance their creatures by completing educational quests and activities. This creates a seamless blend where pet development mirrors the child's own skill growth, potentially serving as a comprehensive homeschooling alternative.

### Key Inspirations and Differentiators
- **Fluvsies-Like Pet Care**: Players hatch surprise eggs to collect adorable, magical critters (hybrids like unicorn-cats or winged pandas). Nurture them through feeding, bathing, playing, and training—each action triggers mini-games with embedded education (e.g., a trampoline jump puzzle teaches math patterns). Merge duplicates for rarer evolutions, unlocking new abilities or looks.
- **Diablo II RPG Elements**: Creatures "level up" via educational achievements—gain XP from solving science riddles, loot gear (e.g., magical hats boosting "intelligence stats") from history quests, build skills (e.g., "math mastery tree") through repeated challenges, and gather resources (e.g., "knowledge crystals") for upgrades. No violence; focus on exploration and growth in a dreamy, pastel world with gardens, beaches, and adventure zones.
- **Stealth Education as Homeschooling**: Learning is disguised—kids collect/develop critters by mastering subjects (math, science, history, language, etc.). Adaptive difficulty adjusts based on performance; progress tracks real-world skills (e.g., grade-level alignment). Parental dashboard monitors metrics, suggesting custom paths. Over time, completing the game could equate to a full curriculum, with certifications or reports for homeschooling.

### Target Audience and Impact
- Ages 5-12 (expandable), parents/educators seeking engaging alternatives to traditional schooling.
- Promotes empathy (pet emotions), creativity (customization), responsibility (care routines), and deep learning (RPG depth encourages mastery).
- Safe, offline-capable PWA/APK for devices like Amazon Fire Tablets; multilingual for global reach.

### Long-Term Goals
Evolve into a platform: Community-added quests, AI-generated content, multiplayer co-op learning, VR integration. Make education "the most engaging game ever created!"

## Error Resolutions
- **License Loop**: Used edited hashes in license files; avoided looping commands.
- **AgentStuckInLoopError**: Interrupted with C-c; used timeouts.

## Plan Ahead
Follow ROADMAP Phase 2; track via GitHub Projects.

### Session Cleanup (2025-08-25)
Cleaned stuck session; applied stashed changes from repo-polish branch; merged educational-rpg-system branch into main; deleted merged remote branches; all local changes published to main. All branches from previous sessions have been committed, pushed, and cleaned up.

## Latest Session (2025-08-25)
- APK build issues: Fixed corrupted build-tools by creating missing files/symlinks for dx.jar, bcc_compat, lld, etc.; Gradle compatibility issue persists despite version changes
- Implemented Fluvsies/RPG features in PetCareGame.jsx and db.js
- Updated tests/docs as needed

### Phase 3 Implementation Notes:
- Implemented multi-critter parties in PetCareGame.jsx with WebSocket co-op support
- Added homeschool tools: PDF export functionality using jsPDF for progress reports
- Updated RPGAdventure.jsx to sync progress via WebSockets in co-op mode
- Enhanced ParentalDashboard.jsx with Common Core alignment and certification exports
- Updated ROADMAP.md and PROGRESS.md documentation

### Phase 4 Implementation Notes:
- Added i18n support for multiple languages using react-i18next ✓
- Integrated Grok API for AI-driven question generation in aiQuestionGenerator.js ✓
- Implemented voice command functionality for accessibility in PetCareGame.jsx ✓
- Updated ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 3 complete and document Phase 4 features ✓

### APK Build Notes:
- Fixed "Installed Build Tools revision is corrupted" by creating missing files: dx.jar (symlink to d8), bcc_compat, lld, core-lambda-stubs.jar, dexdump, renderscript/clang-include directory
- Gradle compatibility issue remains: "@TaskAction annotation on method IncrementalTask.taskAction$gradle() because interface org.gradle.api.tasks.incremental.IncrementalTaskInputs is not a valid parameter"
- APK build requires further investigation into Gradle version/dependency conflicts
