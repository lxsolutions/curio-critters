   ```

### For Amazon Fire Tablet QA Testing

The app is optimized for tablet testing and can be accessed via WiFi.

#### Local HTTP Server Access
1. Start the frontend server on port 50390 as shown above
2. Get your local IP address:
   ```bash
   hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
   ```
3. Open Silk Browser on your Amazon Fire Tablet
4. Navigate to `http://<local_ip>:50390` (replace `<local_ip>` with your server's IP)
5. Add the app to home screen for PWA installation

#### Testing Instructions
1. **Login**: Test kid login with username and grade selection
2. **Pet Care**: Navigate to pet care section, try feed/play buttons that trigger learning mini-games
3. **Quests**: Complete educational quests with trivia questions from various subjects
4. **Offline Mode**: Disconnect WiFi and verify functionality persists (IndexedDB + service worker caching)
5. **PWA Installation**: Add to home screen in Silk Browser for standalone app experience

   ```

2. Host the static frontend files (from `dist/` directory)

3. Run the backend server on your production environment:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   node server.js
   ```
