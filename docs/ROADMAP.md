# Curio Critters Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines phased development to achieve the full vision: A Fluvsies-inspired pet RPG with Diablo II progression powered by stealth education. Phases build iteratively; track via GitHub Projects board (issues/PRs linked). Use milestones for releases.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Completed - v1.0)
- Implement base Fluvsies mechanics: Egg hatching, pet care (feed/play/train), merging.
- Add initial RPG elements: Basic leveling via mini-games.
- Stealth education: Integrate math/science questions into activities.
- Tech: React frontend, Express backend, PWA/APK support, tests.
- Status: Done (commit e2fd131); all features passing tests.

## Phase 2: RPG Integration and Education Depth (Next - v1.1, Target: Q4 2025)
- Expand Diablo II elements: Skill trees for critters (e.g., "math branch" unlocks abilities), gear/loot system (educational rewards).
- More subjects: Add history/language quests; dynamic generation via AI microagent.
- Enhancements: Offline sync improvements, parental dashboard expansions (curriculum reports).
- Testing: E2E with Cypress; kid QA on Fire Tablet APK.
- Milestones: #1 - RPG mechanics; #2 - New subjects.

## Phase 3: Polish and Expansion (v2.0, Target: Q1 2026)
- Advanced features: Multi-critter parties, co-op modes, VR/AR hints.
- Community: Open for contributions (new quests via PRs); integrate feedback.
- Homeschooling tools: Certification exports, adaptive curricula based on standards (e.g., Common Core).
- Deployment: App stores submission; web version scaling.

## Phase 4: Long-Term Evolution (Ongoing)
- AI-driven personalization (e.g., Grok API for quests).
- Global features: More languages, accessibility (voice commands).
- Metrics: Track impact (e.g., learning gains); partnerships with schools.

## Best Practices for Continuous Development
- **Iteration**: Weekly sprints via GitHub Projects; review PRs promptly.
- **Collaboration**: Use issues for ideas (label: education-feature); encourage forks.
- **Quality**: CI/CD for tests; semantic commits.
- **Updates**: Revise this roadmap quarterly; changelog for releases.
